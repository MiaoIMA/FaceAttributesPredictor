# FaceAttributesPredictor
This project focuses on predicting age, gender, and race from facial images using the UTKFace dataset and a simple CNN model. Through strategic data pre-processing, we addressed dataset imbalances and selectively utilized models, avoiding computationally-heavy architectures like ResNet and VGG due to training resource considerations.
